During the Computer Network course, we were challenged to implement a reliable transport protocol. The goal of this task was to successfully send packets from a sender to a receiver and ensure that all packets arrived at the destination correctly and in the correct order.

To achieve this, we had to carefully design and develop a robust protocol that would account for potential issues such as packet loss or packet corruption. We had to ensure that the packets were transmitted efficiently and effectively, while still being able to maintain the integrity of the data being transmitted.

Through this project, we gained a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in developing reliable communication protocols and the importance of addressing potential issues that can arise during transmission.
It was a valuable learning experience that provided us with practical knowledge and skills that we can apply in real-world networking scenarios.
